Mongregator - The Monitoring Aggregator
=======================================

Rational
--------
Over the years, many monitoring applications have been developed in
OpenSource space. MRTG, Nagios, Cacti, Ganglia, Torrus or collectd to
name just a few. Each of them comes with its own webinterface for exploring
the information gathered by the particular System.

Often the web interfaces have been developped several years ago and do not
make much use of todays Web technologies.

Deploying a monitoring system within a whole organization often requires a
major effort.  Especiallly when it is to be integrated other parts of the
infrastructure.

Two scenarios seem to be prevail. Several different monitoring Systems are
running in parlell or the local monitoring system is a heavily customized
version of some open source system.  In both cases, the user experiance is
often not ideal, up to the point where proprietary solutions are being
considered due to their supperior flashiness and marketing literature.

Mongregator is an aggregating frontend to a wide array of monitoring
systems. Its plugin system provides an easy route to integrating several
systems into a single instance of Mongragator.
