=head1 Mongregator Architectural Overview

=head2 Concept

Mongregator is an aggregating front end to a wide array of monitoring
systems. Mongregator uses a modular architecture which allows for simple
integration with other system.

RRDtool has become a kind of common storage and presentation system for many
monitoring systems. Mongregator has therefore rich support for rrdtool based
data stores.

Accessing a monitoring system from Mongregator can be as superficial as
directly including a web page into a Mongregator iframe or it can be as deep
as giving mongragator direct access to the rrd files.

There are two strategies for integrating an existing tool with Mongregator:

=over

=item *

Write a L<tool specific plugin|/"Plugin API"> for Mongragator and use whatever methods for interaction the tool already supports.

=item *

Add a JSON RPC Mongregator interface to your monitoring system for Mongregator to access directly using the Mongregator L<native plugin|/"Native Mongregator Integration">.
