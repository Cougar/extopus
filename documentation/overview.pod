=head1 Extopus Architectural Overview

=head2 Nodes

Extopus is an aggregating front end to a wide array of monitoring
systems.

Extopus is built arround a notion of nodes. Each node has a set of
properties. Some properties are mandatory, others are optional. Extopus can
use common property values between nodes to build arbitrary tree structures.

 {
   location: 'New York',
   customerId: 9388444,
   sourceType: 'mrtg-34',
   sourceLink: '/path/to/page.html',
   deviceIp: '192.134.1.2',
   accessId: 'oeGroup',
   expireBy: 399848784
 }

Each node can be associated with additional informational displays that get
presented as the user selects the node. The information can be presented
using a variety of display widgets provided by extopus (iframe, tabular with
csv-download, graph).

Extopus provides an object oriented plugin system for writing interfaces to
existing monitoring tools, plugins can also access the output of other
plugins for ultimate flexibility.

=head2 Access Control

It may be desirable to restict system access to a sub-set of nodes, for a
particular user. Access control plugins can impose arbitrary restrictions on
which nodes become visible to users and other plugins.

=head2 Datastore

For performance reasons, all nodes are kept in the extopus database
(mongodb). Node can get to the database via nightly polling jobs or also on
demand upon special events (like the authentication of a user).

Every node in the datastore has an expiery property to make sure stale nodes can be removed automatically.
